## How Many

**How Many** is a simple ESO addon that display's the amount of whatever you looted, and how many of the same items you already own in your Bag, Bank or Crafting Bag. I created it because I like keeping an eye on my stock whilst harvesting. Maybe you do too.

#### Usage:

There are just two commands:
/howmany on
/howmany off
